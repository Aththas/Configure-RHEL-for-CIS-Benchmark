## Generate a hash for the password
    $ grub2-setpassword

**When prompted, enter the selected password**


The grub2 bootloader should have a superuser account and password protection enabled to protect boot-time settings. Since plaintext passwords are a security risk, generate a hash for the password. Password protection on the bootloader configuration ensures that users with physical access cannot trivially alter important bootloader settings.
These settings include which kernel to use and whether to enter single-user mode.
