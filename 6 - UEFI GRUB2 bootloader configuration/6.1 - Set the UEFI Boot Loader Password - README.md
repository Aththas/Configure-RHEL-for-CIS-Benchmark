## Generate a hash for the password
    $ grub2-setpassword

The grub2 bootloader should have a superuser account and password protection enabled to protect boot-time settings. Since plaintext passwords are a security risk, generate a hash for the password. Password protection on the bootloader configuration ensures that users with physical access cannot trivially alter important bootloader settings.
These settings include which kernel to use and whether to enter single-user mode.

## Warning
To prevent hard-coded passwords, automatic remediation of this control is not available. Remediation must be automated as a component of machine provisioning or followed manually as outlined above.
Do NOT manually add the superuser account and password to the grub.cfg file, as the grub2-mkconfig command overwrites this file.
