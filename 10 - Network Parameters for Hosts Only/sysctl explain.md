# sysctl Command
The sysctl command in Linux is used to view and modify kernel parameters at runtime. Kernel parameters control various aspects of system behavior and can be adjusted to optimize performance, enhance security, or modify system functionality.

## Checking Configuration Files
In the initial commands, we checked for the net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects parameter in various configuration files to see if it was already set or to find where it might be configured. This helps in identifying existing configurations that might override our desired setting.

## Why Check sysctl.conf Again?
After verifying settings in other configuration files, we check /etc/sysctl.conf specifically because:

1. /etc/sysctl.conf is the primary configuration file for sysctl settings.

2. Ensuring consistency and overriding previous settings if necessary.

3. Making sure that our desired setting is applied even if other configuration files are processed.
