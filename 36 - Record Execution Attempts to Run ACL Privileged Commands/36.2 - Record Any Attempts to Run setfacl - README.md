Since we have already created the file /etc/audit/rules.d/privileged.rules and assigned default permissions. No need to check them again.

## 1. Add following lines to the created file /etc/audit/rules.d/privileged.rules
    $ echo "-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/setfacl -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=privileged" | sudo tee -a /etc/audit/rules.d/privileged.rules

## 2. Since auditd daemon is configured to use the auditctl utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add following lines to the file /etc/audit/audit.rules
    $ echo "-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/setfacl -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -F key=privileged" | sudo tee -a /etc/audit/audit.rules
