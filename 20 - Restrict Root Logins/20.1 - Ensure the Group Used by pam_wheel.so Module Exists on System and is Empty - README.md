## 1. Check for the sugroup in /etc/group
    $ sudo grep "^sugroup:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*" /etc/group

## 2. If not found any, add the sugroup
    $ sudo groupadd sugroup

## 3. Making the group empty
    $ sudo gpasswd -M '' sugroup

The command gpasswd -M '' sugroup removes all members from the group sugroup, making it an empty group with no users. This is useful in scenarios where you want to ensure that no users are part of a specific group, effectively clearing its membership list.

**gpasswd**: This is the command used to administer /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files. It can be used to set group passwords, add and remove users, and set group administrators.

**-M ''**: This option sets the list of group members. The -M option is followed by a comma-separated list of usernames to be added to the group. In this case, the list is empty (''), meaning no users will be members of the group.

**sugroup**: This is the name of the group being modified.
