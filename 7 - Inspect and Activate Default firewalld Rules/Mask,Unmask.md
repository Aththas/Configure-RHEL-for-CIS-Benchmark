# Mask/Unmask

## Imagine you have a special toy box with a toy robot inside it.

1. Masking the Toy Box: When you "mask" the toy box, it's like putting a big lock on it. Nobody can open the toy box to play with the robot.

2. Unmasking the Toy Box: When you "unmask" the toy box, you remove the lock, so people can now open it.

3. Starting the Robot: When you "start" the robot, it's like turning it on. Now, the robot can walk, talk, and do all the fun stuff it’s supposed to do.

4. Enabling the Robot: When you "enable" the robot, it means you make sure the robot turns on automatically every time you open the toy box in the future.

## Now, let’s connect this to the firewall service:

1. Masked Service: If the firewall service is masked, it's locked up, and you can't start it or use it.

2. Unmasked Service: If you unmask the firewall service, you remove the lock, so you can start it.

3. Starting the Service: When you start the firewall service, it begins working right away, protecting your computer.

4. Enabling the Service: When you enable the firewall service, it will start automatically every time your computer turns on.

## Can we enable the firewall service without unmasking and starting?

No, we can't enable a masked service because it's like trying to turn on a robot that is still locked in the toy box.

Yes, we can enable a service without starting it right away. It’s like making sure the robot will turn on automatically every time you open the toy box in the future, even if you don’t turn it on right now.

## What's the difference between unmasking, starting, and enabling?

Unmasking: Removing the lock (so you can start it if you want).

Starting: Turning it on right now (making it work immediately).

Enabling: Making sure it turns on automatically every time in the future (setting it up to always work when needed).


So, unmasking and starting are steps to get the service running now, while enabling makes sure it runs automatically every time your computer starts up.
