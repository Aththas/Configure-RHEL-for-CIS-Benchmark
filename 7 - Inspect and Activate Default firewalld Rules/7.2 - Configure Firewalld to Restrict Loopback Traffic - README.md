## 1. To configure firewalld to restrict loopback traffic to the lo interface for IPv4:
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address="127.0.0.1" destination not address="127.0.0.1" drop'

## 2. To configure firewalld to restrict loopback traffic to the lo interface for IPv6:
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv6 source address="::1" destination not address="::1" drop'

## Code Explanation

**1. firewall-cmd**: The command-line interface for firewalld, used to configure firewall rules.

**2. --permanent**: Ensures that the rule is saved permanently in the firewalld configuration. Without this, the rule would be temporary and would be lost after a reboot.

**3. --zone=trusted**: Specifies the zone to which the rule will be added. The trusted zone is used for trusted network connections.

**4. --add-rich-rule**: Adds a rich rule to the specified zone. Rich rules provide a more flexible and detailed way to define firewall rules compared to simple rules.

**5. 'rule family=ipv4 source address="127.0.0.1" destination not address="127.0.0.1" drop'**: This is the rich rule being added, enclosed in single quotes to be     interpreted as a single argument.



**5.1. rule**: Indicates the start of a rich rule definition.

**5.2. family**=ipv4: Specifies that the rule applies to IPv4 traffic.

**5.3. source address**="127.0.0.1": Matches traffic originating from the IPv4 loopback address 127.0.0.1.

**5.4. destination not address**="127.0.0.1": Matches traffic whose destination address is not 127.0.0.1. This ensures the traffic is not routed to a different network interface.

**5.5. drop**: Specifies the action to take for matching traffic. In this case, the traffic is dropped (blocked).
