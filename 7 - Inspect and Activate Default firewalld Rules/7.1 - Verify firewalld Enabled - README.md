## 1. Check if the firewalld service is enabled
    $ sudo systemctl is-enabled firewalld.service

This command will return one of the following statuses:

    enabled: The service is set to start automatically at boot.
    disabled: The service is not set to start automatically at boot.
    static: The service unit file is not enabled but may be used by other units.
    masked: The service is masked and cannot be started.
    
## 2. If Service is enabled
No action needed because the service is already enabled

## 3. If disbaled
Need to start the service and then enable it

    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable firewalld.service

## 4. If static
For static services, the concept of enabling doesn't apply in the traditional sense. Instead, you manage them by ensuring they are dependencies for other services or starting them manually as needed.

## 5. If masked
Need to unmask, start and then enable the service

    $ sudo systemctl unmask firewalld.service
    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable firewalld.service
