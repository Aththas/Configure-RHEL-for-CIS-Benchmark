## Make the default permission into 0640 for the log files created by rsyslog
    $ echo '$FileCreateMode 0640' | sudo tee -a /etc/rsyslog.d/99-rsyslog_filecreatemode.conf

This setting ensures that any log files created by rsyslog will have the specified permissions (0640), enhancing security by restricting who can read or modify the log files. This is particularly important to protect sensitive data, as mentioned in the rationale of the table you've provided.
