## 1. find INACTIVE in /etc/default/useradd
    $ sudo grep -P '^[/s]*INACTIVE[/s]*=[/s]*' /etc/default/useradd

## 2. If found, replace it with INACTIVE=30 (since i got INACTIVE=-1, i replaced that value)
    $ sudo sed -i 's/^INACTIVE=-1/INACTIVE=30/g' etc/default/useradd

## 3. If not found, add INACTIVE=30
    $ echo "INACTIVE=30" | sudo tee -a /etc/default/useradd

Setting INACTIVE=30 in /etc/default/useradd ensures that an account is disabled 30 days after the password expires, enhancing security by managing inactive accounts

Imagine you have a toy that you need to play with every day. If you don't play with it for 30 days, it gets locked in a box. You won't be able to play with it again until someone unlocks the box for you. This rule helps to make sure that you don't forget about your toys and leave them lying around where someone else could take them without you knowing.
