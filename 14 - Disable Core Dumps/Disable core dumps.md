# Technical Explanation:
Disabling core dumps helps to prevent the unintended exposure of sensitive information. Core dumps are files that capture the memory of an application at a specific point in time, usually when it crashes. These files can contain sensitive data such as passwords, encryption keys, or personal user data. By disabling core dumps, you reduce the risk of this sensitive information being accessed or exploited by unauthorized individuals.

## Disable Core Dump Backtraces:

**Core Dump**: A file that records the memory state of a running program when it crashes.
**Backtrace**: A report that shows the sequence of function calls that led to the crash.
**Disabling Core Dump Backtraces**: This prevents the creation of detailed reports that could expose the inner workings of your programs and any sensitive data they might be handling at the time of the crash.

## Disable Storing Core Dumps:

**Storing Core Dumps**: Saving the core dump files to disk.
**Disabling Storing Core Dumps**: This stops the system from saving these files, which can contain sensitive information like passwords or personal data, thereby reducing the risk of this data being accessed or exploited.


# Simple Explanation:
Imagine your computer is like a big book where you write down everything you do. Sometimes, when something goes wrong, your computer takes a snapshot of what it was doing and saves it in a special file, like taking a picture of the book's page. This special file can help people understand what went wrong, but it might also show secret information that you don't want others to see. Disabling core dumps is like telling your computer not to take those pictures, so your secrets stay safe.

## Disable Core Dump Backtraces:

Imagine when a toy breaks, someone takes notes about how it was being used before it broke. These notes can show all the steps and secrets of how the toy works. By not taking these notes, we keep the toy's secrets safe.
## Disable Storing Core Dumps:

Imagine if every time a toy broke, we saved all the pieces and parts in a box. Sometimes, these pieces can show things we don't want others to see. By not saving the pieces, we make sure no one can see any secret parts of the toy.
