# Kernel Parameter
Kernel Parameters are settings that configure the operating system kernel's behavior. These parameters can control various aspects of the system's operation, such as memory management, process scheduling, network settings, and security features. They can be set at boot time or adjusted dynamically while the system is running using tools like sysctl.

Imagine your computer is like a big, smart robot. It has a special notebook where it keeps instructions on how to do different things, like how much energy to use, how to talk to other robots, or when to take a nap. These instructions are called kernel parameters.
**It's like a rule or instruction for the robot. It tells the robot how to behave in different situations.**

## Examples:
**net.ipv4.ip_forward**: Controls IP forwarding.

**vm.swappiness**: Adjusts the kernel's tendency to swap memory pages.

**kernel.randomize_va_space**: Controls address space layout randomization (ASLR) for security.
