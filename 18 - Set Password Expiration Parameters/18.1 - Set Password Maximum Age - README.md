## 1. check for the PASS_MAX_DAYS in /etc/login.defs
    $ sudo grep "^[/s]*PASS_MAX_DAYS[/s]*" /etc/login.defs

## 2. If found, replace it with PASS_MAX_DAYS   365
    $ sudo sed -i "s/^[[:space:]]*PASS_MAX_DAYS[[:space:]]*99999/PASS_MAX_DAYS   365/g" /etc/login.defs

## 3. If not, add them,
    $ echo "PASS_MAX_DAYS   365" | sudo tee -a /etc/login.defs

Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the operating system passwords could be compromised.

Setting the password maximum age ensures users are required to periodically change their passwords. Requiring shorter password lifetimes increases the risk of users writing down the password in a convenient location subject to physical compromise.
