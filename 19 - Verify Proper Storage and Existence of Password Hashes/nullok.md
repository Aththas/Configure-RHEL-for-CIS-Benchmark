## What is nullok?
nullok: This option allows users to log in with a blank (null) password. If nullok is present in the PAM configuration, it means that the authentication system will permit users who do not have a password set to authenticate successfully.

**simply it is null-ok.**

In the context of the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) configuration, nullok is a directive (often referred to as an option or parameter) used with the pam_unix.so module.
