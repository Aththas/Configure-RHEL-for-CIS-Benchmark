# NFTables
nftables is a powerful and modern framework for packet filtering and network address translation in Linux. It unifies multiple tools into a single interface, offers enhanced performance, and provides a more flexible and easier-to-use syntax compared to iptables. It is the recommended replacement for the older iptables framework, providing better performance and more features for modern network management.

## 1. Disable nftables Service
    $ sudo systemctl disable nftables

## 2. If it didn't work
#### 2.1 stop nftables.service in /usr/bin/systemctl (if nftables.service is running)
    $ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl stop 'nftables.service'

#### 2.2 disable nftables.service in /usr/bin/systemctl (if nftables.service is enable)
    $ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl disable 'nftables.service'

#### 2.3 mask nftables.service in /usr/bin/systemctl (if nftables.service is unmask)
    $ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl mask 'nftables.service'

#### 2.4 Check for socket activation
    $ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl -q list-unit-files 'nftables.socket'

###### 2.4.1 stop nftables.socket in /usr/bin/systemctl
    $ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl stop 'nftables.socket'

###### 2.4.2 mask nftables.socket in /usr/bin/systemctl
    $ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl mask 'nftables.socket'

#### 2.5 Service should be 'inactive', not 'failed' after reboot though
    $ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl reset-failed 'nftables.service' || true

## Why need to disable nftables?

Imagine you have two different coaches (firewalld and nftables) trying to guide the same sports team at the same time. Each coach might have different strategies and plans. If both coaches give instructions at the same time, the players (your computer's network) could get confused about which coach to listen to, and things might not work well.

### firewalld and nftables:

Think of firewalld and nftables as two coaches who help control how your computer talks to other computers on the internet.
firewalld is like a head coach that uses different tools, including nftables, to manage the team.

### Potential Conflict:

If both coaches (firewalld and nftables) are giving instructions at the same time, they might tell the team to do different things. This could cause confusion and problems.
For example, firewalld might say, "**Block all traffic from this place,**" while nftables might say, "**Allow traffic from that place.**" The computer wouldn't know which rule to follow.

### nftables as a Backend:

nftables is one of the tools that firewalld can use to do its job. It’s like one of the assistant coaches.
firewalld can use nftables to set up rules for how the computer communicates, but it manages these rules through its own interface, making things easier to control and understand.

## Summary
**Disabling nftables**: The systemctl disable nftables command prevents the nftables service from starting automatically when the computer boots up.

**Conflict Explanation**: Running both firewalld and nftables directly can cause conflicts, like having two coaches giving different instructions at the same time. Since firewalld can use nftables as one of its tools, it’s better to let firewalld manage nftables to avoid confusion and ensure smooth operation.

By understanding these concepts, you can see why it’s important to avoid running both firewalld and nftables independently and to let firewalld manage nftables to prevent conflicts.
