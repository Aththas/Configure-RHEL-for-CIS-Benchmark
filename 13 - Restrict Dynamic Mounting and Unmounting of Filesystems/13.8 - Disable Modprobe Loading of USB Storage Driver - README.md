## Why You Might Disable usb-storage
usb-storage is a kernel module in Linux that allows the operating system to communicate with USB mass storage devices, such as USB flash drives, external hard drives, and SD card readers. This module makes it possible for the system to read from and write to these devices, treating them like any other storage device.

Disabling usb-storage on your Linux system can help improve security and system integrity, particularly in environments where USB storage devices are not needed or could pose a security risk.

Imagine you have a special toy box that you can plug into your computer to add or take away toys (like a USB drive). But sometimes, people might use this toy box to take your toys without asking or put bad toys (like malware) into your collection
