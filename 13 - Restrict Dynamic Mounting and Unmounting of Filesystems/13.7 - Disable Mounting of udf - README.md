## Why You Might Disable udf

UDF (Universal Disk Format) is a file system standard developed by the Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA). It is widely used for optical media like CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. UDF is designed to be a versatile file system that can be read and written by different operating systems, making it ideal for data interchange.

Imagine you have a special box for storing CDs and DVDs, but you donâ€™t use CDs or DVDs anymore because you have everything on your computer.
