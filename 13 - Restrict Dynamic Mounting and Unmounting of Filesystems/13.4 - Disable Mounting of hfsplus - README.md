## Why You Might Disable hfsplus
HFS (Hierarchical File System) is a file system used primarily by older Apple Macintosh computers. It was the main file system for Mac OS until it was replaced by HFS+ and later by the Apple File System (APFS). HFS organizes and stores files on a disk in a hierarchical manner, using directories and subdirectories.
