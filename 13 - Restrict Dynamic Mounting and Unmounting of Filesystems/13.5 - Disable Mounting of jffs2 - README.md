## Why You Might Disable jffs2
JFFS2 (Journaling Flash File System version 2) is a file system designed specifically for use on flash memory devices. It is commonly used in embedded systems that use flash memory storage. JFFS2 provides features like wear leveling, which helps extend the life of flash memory, and is designed to handle the unique characteristics of flash memory, such as erasing blocks before writing to them.

Imagine you have a special kind of storage box that you only use for keeping your very special stickers. This box has some unique features, like making sure the stickers donâ€™t get worn out too quickly. But if you don't need to use this special box, you might want to lock it away.
